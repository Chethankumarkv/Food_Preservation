             The best way to store whole kiwis depends on the level of ripeness—in general, you can store ripe kiwis in the refrigerator and unripe kiwis on a kitchen counter. If storing an unripe kiwi on a countertop, keep it at room temperature and away from direct sunlight. After a few days, your kiwi will ripen and be ready to enjoy. <br>

             Store kiwifruits that are already ripe in the refrigerator, away from other ethylene-producing fruits, such as apples, avocados, mangoes, pears, and tomatoes. The ethylene gas will speed up the ripening process, causing early spoilage. You can also store kiwi slices in the refrigerator; simply place your cut kiwi in an airtight container or plastic bag and store in the fridge for up to two days.

            <p> Methods of Preserving coconut<br>

            There are several methods of preserving coconut, including drying, freezing, and pickling. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Drying coconut is the easiest method, but it produces a product with a different texture and flavor than fresh coconut. Freezing coconut retains its fresh flavor better than other methods, but it requires more time and effort. Pickling is the most work-intensive method, but it produces the closest taste to fresh coconut.<br>
            One way to preserve coconut is to keep it in the fridge. This will help to keep the coconut fresh for up to two weeks. You can also freeze coconut, and it will last for up to six months.<br>
            Another way to preserve coconut is by drying it. This can be done either in the sun or in an oven. Once the coconut has been dried, it can be stored in an airtight container and will last for several months.

            In order to preserve your custard applies I would suggest canning them since you have already frezing it. It does lose it's freshness to an extent, however, the shelf life would last longer. Canning is also a good method as is can use vacuum sealed packaging which restricts air into the packaging which is what causes micro-organism growth an multiplication.

                2.To store guava, place the guava fruits in a refrigerator for up to five days. And if you want to store for too long, slice the guava and place in sugar syrup before refrigerating. You can store guava this way for one year.<br>
                In this method of preserving guava, you need to wash the guava and pat dry it. Then, place the guava fruit on a clean plate or cutting board.<br>
                Use your favorite peeling knife to peel out the rinds from the fruits. After peeling, cut the fruit into slices.

Prepare a sugar syrup that is made using equal portions of sugars and water. Then, place these slices of guava fruits into the syrup.

Allow them to soak in the sugar syrup very well. Then, place these slices of guava fruits into the syrup.

Transfer the slices of guava into an airtight plastic container or nylon bag. Cover and make sure you leave a small space where a small amount of air can enter into the container.

This small space can help prolong the shelf life of your guava by reducing the freezing time. Place the container in a refrigerator and store for up to a year.

              1. Freeze Fresh Berries
Every day throughout the harvest season, I gather at least one gallon of berries, so I need to freeze them because I don’t want to can or cook every single day. The easiest way to preserve mulberries is to freeze them to use later.<br>
             2. Ice Cream
If you want a sweet, homemade treat to cool you down this summer, make some mulberry ice cream. When paired with sugar and cream, mulberries have a fantastic combination of tangy yet sweet that our family loves.

Making mulberry ice cream is a great way to preserve mulberries since ice cream stays good in a freezer for many months. <br>
3. Lavender Jam with Honey
If you want to make a different variety of mulberry jam, this recipe looks amazing. Adding lavender to the recipe gives it more of an aromatic property. You have to have fresh lavender for this recipe; dried won’t work as well.

            Methods of Preserving Mmusk melon<br>
Store melons at room temperature for up to 2 days to ripen them. If your melons aren't ripe yet, you can keep them unrefrigerated for up to 2 days. Leave melons uncovered on a counter or tabletop. Alternatively, keep melons in a closed paper bag to accelerate the ripening process.<br>

Buy or make perforated plastic bags to refrigerate melons in. Melons need both moisture and cold to stay fresh, which can be difficult to achieve. The best approach is to refrigerate melons in perforated bags to keep them moist without letting them dry out. Buy perforated plastic bags or make one by poking about 20 small holes in an ordinary bag with a pen or hole punch<br>
Store ripe melons in the fridge for up to a week. Store melons in your fridge for a maximum of 7 days to prevent spoiling. Discard melons if you notice signs of spoiling. These signs may include foul odor and spots of mold<br>

Refrigerate cut melon in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Place cut melon pieces in a resealable, airtight plastic container. Keep it in the fridge for no more than 3 days before discarding it. Ripe, cut melon will start to disintegrate after this time.
You can also put cut melon in airtight zipper-lock bags to refrigerate it.

2. Boiled whole and frozen for making future orange cakes such as this amazing choc orange one or this almond and orange cake. Or you could make up the cake and freeze it using either recipe or I also love Rhonda's whole orange cake recipe if I don't need a flourless version.<br>

3. Dried orange slices. These are delicious to snack on as is, decorate desserts with or dip in dark chocolate - choose your own adventure. I dried mine using my dehydrator but you could also do so in a very low oven.<br>
4. Orange cordial - another nod to Rhonda here for her adaptable summer cordial info.<br>

Put the pineapple pieces into a container or bag that seals tightly. Cut pineapple pieces release a lot of sticky juice that you don’t want leaking all through your fridge. Your best storage option is a glass or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. If you use a zip-close bag, make sure it’s closed completely—and seal it in another zip-close bag just to be sure <br>

Add a splash of orange juice to the container to reduce browning. Slight browning won’t affect the flavor or quality of the stored pineapple, but it does make it look less appealing. Orange juice contains ascorbic acid, which helps to slow the browning of cut fruit. Just a light splash of OJ should do the job.[2]
Lemon juice is often used to slow the browning of cut fruits, and will work here as well. However, the juice you choose imparts some flavor and aroma to the cut fruit, and orange juice pairs better with pineapple than lemon juice!

            <p> Methods of Preserving Strawberry  <br>
            Strawberry preserves are among the most popular, and an excellent way to lock in their flavor. A simple strawberry jam can have just three ingredients: Strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Keep in mind that strawberries are not naturally high in pectin, so this jam will have a softer set. There are many variations on this, with added pectin, low sugar, and supplemental flavors. Here are a few recipes:<br>
            Dried strawberries are a delicious addition to cereal, yogurt, baked goods and more. A dehydrator is the most recommended tool for the job, though they may also be dried in the oven.<br>

            <p> Methods of Preserving Berry<br>
            Hypericum berries are very hardy. If they came to you fresh, you should have no problems. For best results, use a little piece of tissue paper (facial or toilet) soaked in water at the bottom of the stem and wrap it as you would other flowers for a corsage. Keep them misted. Crowning Glory or Finishing Touch is also good to use to keep them fresher, longer. Be sure to keep them in the fridge at 38-40 degrees until you are ready to use them.

            It can be preserved by using tamarind storage containers. Keep complete pods at room temperature in a cool, dark area. After opening, keep pods in the refrigerator firmly wrapped or capped for at least three months. With a sharp, hefty knife, cut off the quantity you intend to utilize<br>
            At room temperature, they last a maximum of a week depending on how hot the temperature is. The hotter the weather, the faster the tamarind will ripen. To store at room temperature keep the tamarinds on the countertop uncovered if the shells have not been cracked open. The shell will keep the pulp fresh for a couple of days.

            1. Freeze the juice and for the peel either zest and preserve or dry slices of peel. The zest can be frozen or dried and used in any dish where you would add a bit of citrus flavour. The peel is great for adding to tea - especially chai. Or in a non-edible use I've added them to homemade fire lighters before too.<br>

2. Boiled whole and frozen for making future orange cakes such as this amazing choc orange one or this almond and orange cake. Or you could make up the cake and freeze it using either recipe or I also love Rhonda's whole orange cake recipe if I don't need a flourless version.<br>

3. Dried orange slices. These are delicious to snack on as is, decorate desserts with or dip in dark chocolate - choose your own adventure. I dried mine using my dehydrator but you could also do so in a very low oven.<br>
4. Orange cordial - another nod to Rhonda here for her adaptable summer cordial info.<br>

            Keep it somewhere cool, dark, and safe from breaking. 3. Vacuum Sealer Jars. Because vacuum sealing doesn’t remove all oxygen from the container, it is a safe storage method for storing raisins: you don’t have to worry about botulism poisoning. FoodSaver is the most popular vacuum sealer for jars, but there are other options too.
            To store raisins long term, you can follow several processes. Whether freezing, vacuum sealing, or jarring, there is a method that will suit your raisin volume, schedule, and living situation. With this guide, you will never have to throw away expired raisins again.
