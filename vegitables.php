                    Dehydrating is a process of removing water from food, which can then be stored for a more extended period of time. Dehydrating beetroot is a great way to preserve this healthy and delicious vegetable. By removing the water, the beetroot will be less likely to spoil and will have a longer shelf life.<br>
                    One way is to blanch the beetroot in boiling water for two minutes, then remove it from the heat and immediately plunge it into cold water. This will stop the cooking process and help to preserve the beetroot’s color and flavor<br>
                    To clean the beetroot for storage, remove any dirt or debris from the surface of the beetroot. Next, cut off the leaves and stem, leaving only the root itself.<br>
                    Pickling is a great way to preserve beetroot<br>

                Bitter gourds should be consumed within 2-3 days of purchase. They tend to lose their firmness rather quickly. They will also start to ripen and become more bitter if kept for too long. They are quite delicate and are prone to damage if not stored properly. So, store them wrapped in a plastic bag in the bottom drawer of the refrigerator for a maximum of 2-3 days.<br>

Before preserving fresh cabbage, always wash your hands, just like when handling any fresh produce. Remove outer leaves that have insect-damage or wilting. Before using cabbage, cut out the core from the bottom of the head using a sharp knife. Rinse the leaves with cold, running water.<br>
Preserving Cabbage by Canning
Canning is a home gardener’s go-to way to store produce. How to preserve squash and many other veggies involves a similar process, with only minor deviations, depending on the vegetable.<br>
Storing Cabbage in the Refrigerator
Unlike other vegetables, it’s possible to store cabbage for long periods with the right precautions. Wrap a cabbage head in plastic wrap, then place it in a plastic bag.

Place the pack in a refrigerator set at a maximum temperature of 41°F. Storing it this way keeps the cabbage good for up to two months.

Taking advantage of the crisper drawer in the fridge is also the best way to store celery to keep it crisp and fresh.

                Preserve Peppers Naturally
There are several home preservation methods to use when it comes to peppers. The best preservation method depends on the variety of pepper and the thickness of the skin.

It’s very simple to grow peppers, no matter what the variety. Grow cayenne pepper, bell peppers, or jalapenos.

You can find many other common types of peppers from which to choose, too. Of course, you can also buy them from the store, but growing bell pepper from seed is easy as long as they have the right amount of sun, water, and fertilizer.

There is even a way to grow bell peppers in containers, whether inside or out. And, there’s nothing better than growing your own produce, harvesting peppers and other fruits and vegetables, and then preserving them in your favorite way

                    Methods of Preserving Celery<br>
                    When you buy celery, avoid the plastic bag. Keeping produce in plastic will contain the ethylene it emits, which makes the celery—and other produce—rot faster. When you take it out of the plastic, you allow your celery to breathe.<br>
                    Celery must be cleaned before you cook with it. And if you plan on washing your celery as soon as you bring it home, be sure to separate the stalks and chop the leaves off.

Separating the stalks helps you get the hard-to-reach dirt and bacteria. Then, wash each stalk, one by one, in cold water and pat dry.<br>

Wash and dry your chilies. Rinse them under cool running water, taking care to wash away dirt and other debris. Pick out bruised or damaged chilies, since these won't keep for long periods of time. Pat the chilies dry with a paper towel before proceeding..<br>
2.Lay them out on a wire rack. You can use a cooling rack or another rack that has vents to allow air circulation from below. If possible, avoid using a solid cooking sheet or tray, since the lack of air flow will make it more difficult for the peppers to dry evenly.
Put the tray in a sunny, well-ventilated room. The kitchen windowsill is a great spot.
Let them dry for three or more days, then store them in an airtight container.

Try stringing and hanging the chilies. This is an easy and decorative way to dry them. Once the chilies are dry, you can keep them hanging up or store them for later use.

                <p>Methods of Preserving Cluster Beans<br>
                Just trim the tips and stack the long beans vertically in clean, pink-sized jars. Tuck in some garlic cloves, dill fronds and dill weed, a couple of peppercorns, and a pinch of mustard seeds. Then whip up a basic pickle brine and pour it into the jars, leaving 1/2 an inch headspace. Use a chopstick or other long tool to release any air bubbles. Then put on the two-part caps and process in a boiling water bath for about 15 minutes.<br>
                Since beans are low-acid, the only way you can preserve them safely this way is by pressure canning them. This increases the heat above what a boiling water bath can do, thus killing off any potential pathogens. Some people like to use the cold pack method for beans. This involves putting raw cut beans into clean jars, covering them with boiling water with 1″ of headspace, then processing in a pressure canner.

                Curry leaves are an important ingredient in many curries and other dishes from South Asia. They have a distinctive flavor and aroma that can be difficult to replicate with other ingredients. If you can’t find fresh curry leaves, you can preserve them so that they will last for several months. Here’s how to do it:
                    <br>
                    1. Start with fresh, clean curry leaves. If they are not fresh, they will not preserve well.
2. Place the curry leaves in a single layer on a plate or tray.
3. Put the plate or tray in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight.
4. Leave the curry leaves for 2-3 days, or until they are completely dried out.
5. Once the curry leaves are dry, store them in an Airtight container in a cool, dark place. They will keep for several months this way.

                The simplest means of cold storage for your spuds is to freeze them while they’re raw. Raw potatoes convert some of their starch into sugars when stored at freezing temperatures, but they’re still perfect for both main and side dishes.

Always start with young and healthy potatoes to ensure you get unspoiled Yukon Golds, red potatoes, russets, or other potato varieties after thawing them.<br>
Store Mashed Potatoes in the Freezer
Freezing raw potatoes is a simple process, but that approach requires you to do some cooking after you thaw the veggies. Freeze your mashed potatoes for a quicker solution. Mashed potatoes are already cooked and perfect for the freezer.<br>
Dry Your Potatoes for Long-Term Storage
Because they have high humidity, potatoes spoil in a hurry. The best way to prevent this undesirable outcome is to take water out of the equation and dry the potatoes. When you dehydrate spuds, they stay healthy and ready for reconstitution and use for up to a decade

                    Refrigeration

This is, of course, the most common way of storing tomatoes that you’re going to eat within a week or so.

I always clean mine and pop the stems off if possible before I put them in the fridge, but that’s just to save a little time later. To keep them the longest this way, put them in the crisper drawer. <br>

Freezing

Most people don’t think about freezing tomatoes, but it’s a good way to go as long as you have the freezer space. If course, they aren’t going to be the same as a fresh tomato, but frozen tomatoes are great in sauces and soups. <br>
Wash the tomatoes then remove the stem, core, and any bruised or bad spots. If you want, you can scald them to remove the skins. That’s completely optional. Cut them in half, or quarter them if they’re longer or wider than 2 inches.<br>
Make Tomato Powder

Tomato powder is absolutely delicious and stores fabulously so this is a great way to preserve tomatoes. Just add a couple of tablespoons to whatever you’re making (adjust the amount according to taste).

                Wash your turmeric, making sure to get all the dirt off. You might want to use a brush for this. This will remove any dirt and also any residual pesticides that may be on the root.
Pat the turmeric dry with a paper towel. Make sure that the root is totally dry before you store it, as this will stop any mold from growing.
Put your turmeric into a brown paper bag before putting it into the fridge. The brown paper will absorb any moisture, especially in a damp fridge environment. If you don’t have a brown paper bag handy, you can also wrap your turmeric root in a clean piece of paper towel and place it into a plastic bag.
You can store your turmeric in the fridge for up to two weeks

                Freezing Green Beans
One of the most common methods of preserving green beans is to freeze them. In fact, frozen green beans are better for you than any other type of green beans (with the exception of raw beans, of course). <br>
Make Dilly Beans
Dilly beans, also known as pickled green beans, are delicious to eat fresh out of the jar. They can also be added to salads or stir-fries for a unique spin on a classic dish.<br>
Ferment Your Green Beans
Fermenting green beans is a fantastic method of preserving green beans that will serve you well. Fermented green beans are rich in nutritious probiotics, and you really don’t need any fancy equipment to get started. 

All you need to do is dissolve two teaspoons of non-iodized salt in three cups of filtered water. After washing your green beans, pack them into a canning jar. Make sure they are packed in tightly. Pour your brine over the top of the green beans, ensuring that they are totally covered.

Wash the mushrooms thoroughly in cold water and pat them dry. Hold the mushrooms under cool running water and wash a few at a time, massaging away bits of dirt with your fingers. You can also place the mushrooms in a colander and rinse them all at once. Pat them dry with a paper towel.<br>
Trim off the ends of the stems and slice the mushrooms, if necessary. If the mushrooms are larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm) across, use a sharp knife to slice them into quarters. Feel free to cut them into halves or small slivers, just try to keep all the pieces the same size and thickness.<br>

Place the mushrooms into a lemon juice solution for 5 minutes. Combine 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of lemon juice with 16 fluid ounces (470 mL) of water and stir it together. Then, place each mushroom into the solution and let them sit for 5 minutes. Pat them dry with a paper towel after you take them out. If you don’t mind the mushrooms darkening, skip this step.

                A good pickle is going to extend the shelf life of your onions by as much as a year. I like to slice red onions thin and create a sweet brine to pickle them. I mix them with thinly sliced jalapenos. It sounds like it might be a little much, but the sweet pickle counters the heat.<br>
                2. Fermenting Onions
Fermented onions may not be something you are accustomed to, but they are a very tasty way to store onions long term. Fermenting also imparts loads of beneficial bacteria.<br>
3. Canning Onions
Canning onions is another process that will remove the crunch but will preserve the onion and its flavor for years. Onions are not acidic vegetables, so they will need to be pressure canned.<br>
4. Drying Onions
Drying onions is dominated by two popular methods. Dehydrating and freeze-drying. Both work great and can create a dried onion that will last for years when stored in a way that protects them from moisture

                    Shell the green peas. Collect about 750 grams of peas in a bowl.
Pour some water into a saucepan. You have to have enough water to comfortably immerse the fresh peas in it.
Heat the water. When the water is about to boil, add 2 teaspoons of sugar. Mix well.
Now, add the green peas. Stir once. Keep the heat medium-high for 2 minutes. Turn off the heat.
Adding sugar is mainly to keep the color intact and also to make it all a bit sweeter.
Immediately pass the beans through a sieve. Next, quickly immerse them in ice-cold water or in normal water with ice pieces. Keep the peas here until they become completely cold.
Once again, pass them through a sieve. Collect the green peas.
Now, put the peas into small polythene bags with a ziplock. Make them air-tight.
Keep these bags in the deep freezer.<br>
Use them whenever you want.<br>
These green peas are as tasty and colorful as fresh ones. They cook faster.<br>
